            <p>  After BTS' 9th anniversary, they shocked the world with many collaboration projects with other artists around the globe.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>  BTS created songs with many artists such as Coldplay, Charlie Puth, Benny Blanco, and so much more, causing excitement.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> BTS' popularity gave them the chance to have such collaborations, and they broke records with millions of views and plays on their collaborated songs. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> BTS took these opportunities as a chance to have a break from their own work and to work with others in their Chapter 2 era.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Many thought BTS didn't like collaborating or had issues with other artists, but BTS proved all the haters wrong with these projects.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>BTS wanted to do something different for chapter 2 of their careers, so they started producing more solo music to give fans a taste of their personalities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Each of the members have been producing and writing albums and singles for fans to enjoy while they are on a group hiatus.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> So far (Nov. 2022) Jhope produced an album called Jack-In-The-Box, Jin produced a solo song called The Astronaut, Jungkook collaborated with Charlie Puth,
              and Suga collaborated with Korean star PSY.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                BTS has had a long history of releasing unofficial solo projects on SoundCloud, but now they have been officially releasing them on all platforms.

          <li>
            <p>
               BTS work behind the scenes on their solo projects for very long times to ensure fans can listen to something tells them about the members themselves.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>BTS, being South Korean citizens, are required to enlist in the nation's military for their mandatory military service which is for all males in South Korea.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
               The South Korean government has made exceptions for BTS to put off their enlistment because of how special they are to Korea, but controversies pushed BTS into deciding to fulfill it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Starting on December 13, BTS' oldest member, Jin, will be the first to enlist in the military for 18 months and the other members will be next in the future.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                BTS will have to do their work without Jin while he is away and the same will happen when the others enlist.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Eventually when all of BTS finishes their enlistment, everything will be back to normal for the members and they can continue on with their lives.
