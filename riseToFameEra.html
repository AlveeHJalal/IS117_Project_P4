            <p>BTS has been gaining so many fans globally, that it made sense for them to step out of their comfort zone and hold concerts worldwide.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              They went to so many countries on their tour, such as Japan, USA, UK, Brazil, and many more. There are still some countries with many fans they haven't been to like India.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              BTS's concerts are jam-packed with energy and last about 3 hours and have upto 60,000 seats. Fans from all over the world come to a country just to see BTS.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Their world-tours are what really made their history on this planet. They performed sold-out concerts on huge stadiums like Metlife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, USA.
